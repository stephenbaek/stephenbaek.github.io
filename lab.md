# About Us
The Visual Intelligence Laboratory is a research group conducting fundamental research works in computational geometry, vision, and machine learning.
We target a wide variety of multidisciplinary applications such as geometric machine learning, statistical shape analysis, 4D scanning, computational design and fabrication, digital human modeling, driver state detection/analysis, sports performance analytics, injury prediction, etc.
Interested students, researchers, or any other individuals are always welcome to [contact us](mailto:stephen-baek@uiowa.edu)!

### Bio:
I'm interested in theories and applications of computational geometry and machine learning, or more specifically, I'm interested in mathematical representations and algorithms for learning trends and patterns in geometric objects. For my research, I have a lot of fun with photographs, videos, depth images, 3D models/scans, and medical images. My current and past research spans a variety of interdisciplinary subjects including statistical human body shape analysis and modeling, vision-based human motion tracking and analysis, driver state monitoring in autonomated/autonomous vehicles, data-driven physics simulation, and medical image analysis.

### Bio:
I am a first year Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at the University of Iowa. I received my B.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Iowa in 2018. I now work as a graduate research assistant at the Visual Intelligence Laboratory at the Center for Computer-Aided Design (CCAD) on campus. I am also an ergonomics trainee in the Heartland Center for Occupational Health and Safety. My research focus is on biomechanics and ergonomics, and combining these concepts with machine learning algorithms. I am currently studying the application of machine learning to human motion analysis techniques. 

### Education:
- **B.S.E Biomedical Engineering**, University of Iowa, 2018
