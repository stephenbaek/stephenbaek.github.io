# About Us
The Visual Intelligence Laboratory @ UVA (the "VIVA Lab") is a research group directed by Professor Stephen Baek at the University of Virginia School of Data Science. We tackle both fundamental and applied research problems in **geometric data analysis** to understand the roles of geometry in various scientific phenomena. Interested students, researchers, or any other individuals are always welcome to [contact us](mailto:baek@virginia.edu)!

### Bio:
I'm interested in theories and applications of computational geometry and machine learning. More specifically, I'm interested in mathematical representations and algorithms for learning trends and patterns in geometric objects. For my research, I have a lot of fun with photographs, videos, depth images, 3D models/scans, and medical images. My current and past research spans a variety of interdisciplinary subjects including statistical human body shape analysis and modeling, vision-based human motion tracking and analysis, driver state monitoring in autonomated/autonomous vehicles, data-driven physics simulation, and medical image analysis. See [here](../about) for more details.

### Bio:
I am interested in machine-learning and deep-learning-based applications for solving real-life medical imaging problems. My current and previous research focuses on developing various state-of-the-art deep learning and medical imaging algorithms for segmentation and classification from various types medical image data, and to assist the clinicians in different tasks, including identifying the severity and cause of ophthalmic diseases, and identifying the boundaries of each instance neurons.

### Bio:
I'm an astronomy PhD student in University of Virginia. Previously, I have worked on many areas of astronomy, including analysis and modelling stellar and galaxy dataset from large sky surveys. As an astronomist, I have also received a professional training in data science and I earned master of science in data science (MSDS) degree in Spring 2022 from UVA. I'm currently doing research on acceleration of quantum spin dynamics numerical simulation using physics-aware neural network with Professor Stephen Baek.
