# About Us
The Visual Intelligence Laboratory is a research group I direct at the University of Iowa.
We conduct fundamental research in computational geometry, vision, and machine learning,
targeting at a wide variety of multidisciplinary applications—geometric machine (deep) learning, statistical shape analysis, 4D scanning, computational design and fabrication, digital human modeling, driver state detection/analysis, sports performance analytics, injury prediction, etc.
Interested students, researchers, or any other individuals are always welcome to [contact us](mailto:stephen-baek@uiowa.edu)!

<br/>&nbsp;

### Bio:
I’m interested in theories and applications of computational geometry and machine learning, or more specifically, I’m interested in mathematical representations and algorithms for learning trends and patterns in geometric objects. For my research, I have a lot of fun with photographs, videos, depth images, 3D models/scans, and medical images. My current and past research spans a variety of interdisciplinary subjects including statistical human body shape analysis and modeling, vision-based human motion tracking and analysis, driver state monitoring in autonomated/autonomous vehicles, data-driven physics simulation, and medical image analysis.
