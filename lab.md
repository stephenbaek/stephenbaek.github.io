# About Us
The Visual Intelligence Laboratory is a research group I direct at the University of Iowa.
We conduct fundamental research in computational geometry, vision, and machine learning,
targeting at a wide variety of multidisciplinary applicationsâ€”geometric machine (deep) learning, statistical shape analysis, 4D scanning, computational design and fabrication, digital human modeling, driver state detection/analysis, sports performance analytics, injury prediction, etc.
Interested students, researchers, or any other individuals are always welcome to [contact us](mailto:stephen-baek@uiowa.edu)!

<br/>&nbsp;


# Join Our Group!

We are always looking for a **self-motivated**, highly competent, and friendly graduate students to pursue Ph.D. degree. For all positions, the minimum requirements are as follows:
- Bachelor's degree in a relevant discipline (engineering, computer science, etc.);
- Proficiency in at least one programming language (C/C++, Python, MATLAB, etc.);
- B+ or above in linear algebra or equivalent; AND
- Capability to communicate in spoken/written English.

Students with one or more of the following qualifications will be preferred:
- Master's degree in engineering, computer science, or other relevant areas
- B+ or above in computer vision, machine learning, computer graphics, and/or similar courses
- One or more published articles in peer-reviewed *international* journals/conferences
- Software development experience (other than school projects)

Students with the above qualifications are strongly encouraged to contact Prof. Stephen Baek ([stephen-baek@uiowa.edu](mailto:stephen-baek@uiowa.edu)) by sending an up-to-date CV and official/unofficial transcripts.

### Bio:
I'm interested in theories and applications of computational geometry and machine learning, or more specifically, I'm interested in mathematical representations and algorithms for learning trends and patterns in geometric objects. For my research, I have a lot of fun with photographs, videos, depth images, 3D models/scans, and medical images. My current and past research spans a variety of interdisciplinary subjects including statistical human body shape analysis and modeling, vision-based human motion tracking and analysis, driver state monitoring in autonomated/autonomous vehicles, data-driven physics simulation, and medical image analysis.
