# About Us
The Visual Intelligence Laboratory @ UVA (the "VIVA Lab") is a research group directed by Professor Stephen Baek at the University of Virginia School of Data Science. We tackle both fundamental and applied research problems in **geometric data analysis** to understand the roles of geometry in various scientific phenomena. Interested students, researchers, or any other individuals are always welcome to [contact us](mailto:baek@virginia.edu)!

### Bio:
I'm interested in theories and applications of computational geometry and machine learning. More specifically, I'm interested in mathematical representations and algorithms for learning trends and patterns in geometric objects. For my research, I have a lot of fun with photographs, videos, depth images, 3D models/scans, and medical images. My current and past research spans a variety of interdisciplinary subjects including statistical human body shape analysis and modeling, vision-based human motion tracking and analysis, driver state monitoring in autonomated/autonomous vehicles, data-driven physics simulation, and medical image analysis. See [here](../about) for more details.

### Bio:
I am a Research Assistant at the Visual Intelligence Laboratory at the Center for Computer Aided Design (CCAD). I have received my B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Iowa in 2016 with focus on the Computational Mathematics and Big Data. My research interest is in machine learning, differential geometry, and manifold theory. I am currently studying 3D human models, specifically methods for generating statistically realistic 3D human models.

### Education:
- **B.S. Computer Science**, University of Iowa, 2016.
- **B.S. Mathematics**, University of Iowa, 2016.
