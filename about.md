Hi, my name is Steve Baek. I'm interested in theories and applications of computational geometry and machine learning, or more specifically,
I'm interested in mathematical representations and algorithms for learning trends and patterns in geometric objects.
For my research, I have a lot of fun with photographs, videos, depth images, 3D models/scans, and medical images.
My current and past research spans a variety of interdisciplinary subjects including statistical human body shape analysis and modeling,
vision-based human motion tracking and analysis, driver state monitoring in autonomated/autonomous vehicles, data-driven physics simulation, and medical image analysis.

I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering][mae] from [Seoul National University][snu] in 2009 and 2013, respectively,
both with the best thesis honors.
During my studies, I received the National Science and Engineering Scholarship and the Global Ph.D. Fellowship from the Korean Ministry of Education.
During my postdoctoral training at [Seoul National University][snu], I was also awarded Presidential Postdoc Fellowship by the President of the Republic of Korea.
I had spent roughly two years as a Senior Researcher there, until I moved to the United States for a faculty position in 2015.
Since then, I'm an Assistant Professor of [Industrial and Systems Engineering][ise] at the [University of Iowa][ui].
I also hold secondary appointments in [Electrical and Computer Engineering][ece] and [Radiation Oncology][rad].
I'm directing the [Visual Intelligence Laboratory][lab] at the [Center for Computer-Aided Design][ccad].

Outside of work, I love playing (not watching) baseball and tennis. I played in 2012 SNU League All-Star Games as a first baseman. I also enjoy photography and graphic design.
I'm happily married to my best friend with a sweet little Iowa-native girl.
