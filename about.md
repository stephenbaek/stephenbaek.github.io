Hi, my name is Steve Baek. I'm an applied geometer, researcher, educator, and entrepreneur interested in geometric data analysis.
At the intersection of differential geometry and machine learning, I develop mathematical representations and algorithms for quantifying trends and patterns across geometric objects.
My current and past research span a variety of interdisciplinary subjects including analysis of geometric patterns in physical/biological phenomena (e.g. microstructure morphology of energetic materials, the linkage between tumoral/peritumoral geometry and cancer outcome, etc.), statistical human body shape analysis, observation-based assessment of human performance/ergonomics, etc.
I've been leading a variety of research projects as a (co-)principal investigator sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Air Force, NASA, Army, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Transportation (DOT), Hyundai Motor Company, and others.

I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering][mae] from [Seoul National University][snu] (SNU) in 2009 and 2013, respectively, both with the best thesis honor.
I received the National Science and Engineering Scholarship and the Global Ph.D. Fellowship from the Korean Ministry of Education during my studies.
After graduation, I had been a postdoc at the [Institute of Advanced Machines and Design](http://iamd.snu.ac.kr/eng/index.php) at SNU until 2015, during which I was awarded a Presidential Postdoc Fellowship by the President of the Republic of Korea.
In 2015, I moved to the United States to join the [University of Iowa][ui] as an Assistant Professor of [Industrial and Systems Engineering][ise]. While I was there, I held courtesy appointments in the Departments of [Electrical and Computer Engineering][ece], [Radiation Oncology][rad], and [Applied Mathematical and Computational Sciences][amcs].
I was also a faculty member of the [National Advanced Driving Simulator][nads].
In 2021, I joined the [University of Virginia][uva] (UVA) to be part of building the new [School of Data Science][sds], UVA's 12th school enabled in part by the largest private gift in University history. 
I currently hold an appointment as an Associate Professor of Data Science with Tenure and a courtesy appointment at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, here at UVA.

Aside from my academic role, I founded two startup companies specializing in computer vision and artificial intelligence, called [Inseer, Inc.][inseer] and Vintage Grading and Authentication (VGA), LLC. (doing business as 'Mantis Grading'). Currently, I'm serving as a scientific advisor of Inseer and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Mantis Grading.

Outside of my professional work, I love playing golf, baseball, and tennis (in that order). Fun fact: I played in the 2012 SNU League All-Star Games as a first baseman. I recently became enthusiastic about kayaking (and paddling, in general). I also enjoy photography and graphic design.
