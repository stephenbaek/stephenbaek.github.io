Hi, my name is Steve Baek. I'm an applied geometer, professor, and entrepreneur interested in geometric data analysis.
At the intersection of differential geometry and machine learning, I develop mathematical representations and algorithms for quantifying trends and patterns across geometric objects.
My current and past research spans a variety of interdisciplinary subjects including analysis of geometric patterns in physical/biological phenomena (e.g. microstructure morphology of energetic materials, linkage between tumoral/peritumoral geometry and cancer outcome), statistical human body shape analysis, observation-based assessment of human performance/ergonomics, etc.
I've been serving as a principal investigator of a variety of research projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation, U.S. Air Force, NASA, Department of Transportation, Hyundai Motor Company, and others.

I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering][mae] from [Seoul National University][snu] (SNU) in 2009 and 2013, respectively,
both with the best thesis honor.
I received the National Science and Engineering Scholarship and the Global Ph.D. Fellowship from the Korean Ministry of Education during my studies.
Until 2015, I was a postdoc at the [Institute of Advanced Machines and Design](http://iamd.snu.ac.kr/eng/index.php) at SNU, during which I was awarded Presidential Postdoc Fellowship by the President of the Republic of Korea.
I moved to the United States in 2015 to join the University of Iowa.
Since then, I serve as an Assistant Professor of [Industrial and Systems Engineering][ise] at the [University of Iowa][ui], with courtesy appointments in [Electrical and Computer Engineering][ece], [Radiation Oncology][rad], and [Applied Mathematical and Computational Sciences][amcs].
I direct the [Visual Intelligence Laboratory][lab] and a member of the [National Advanced Driving Simulator][nads].
I'm also CTO and co-founder of Inseer, Inc., an Iowa-based startup specializing in computer vision and artificial intelligence.

Outside of my professional work, I love playing baseball and tennis. I played in 2012 SNU League All-Star Games as a first baseman. I also enjoy photography and graphic design.
